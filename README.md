The main purpose is to make a reliable, low footprint toolchain integration with VS Code and plugins for STM32F0 Devices

## VS Code extensions
The following tools were installed in VS Code for CMAKE and C/C++ environment
	- C/C++ (Microsoft Extension)
	- CMake (twxs.cmake)
	- CMake Tools (vector-of-bool.cmake-tools)
	- CMake Tools Helper (maddouri.cmake-tools-helper)

## CMake 
I've tried it on the cmake version 3.10.2

## ST-Link
I've used the stflash and sterase function form STLink utilities compiled from ... 

## arm-none-eabi-gcc
